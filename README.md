# Chronic-Absenteeism-Dashboard

This repository provides a Chronic Absenteeism PowerBi Dashboard that is powered
off of the the Ed-Fi ODS with AMT - Analytics Middle Tier. This dashboard provides
row level security and filters data based on the users role. For example if a
District Superintendent logs in then it will show data for all schools. If a School
Principal is logged in he or she sees only data for his school. Subsequently a
teacher sees only the students to the sections she teaches.

Supports:

* Ed-Fi Data Standard 3.0 and higher
* Ed-Fi ODS/API Technical Suite 3, version 3.0 and higher
